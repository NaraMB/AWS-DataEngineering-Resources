Contains helpful AWS whitepapers useful for AWS data engineering

## Data Pipelines
[Building secure and reliable data pipelines with Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-glue-best-practices-build-secure-data-pipeline/aws-glue-best-practices-build-secure-data-pipeline.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card#aws-glue-best-practices-build-secure-data-pipeline) (Focuses on fault tolerance and security of the pipelines)

[Building performant data pipelines with Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-glue-best-practices-build-performant-data-pipeline/aws-glue-best-practices-build-performant-data-pipeline.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card) (Focuses on performance best practices)

[Building operationally efficient data pipelines with Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-glue-best-practices-build-efficient-data-pipeline/aws-glue-best-practices-build-efficient-data-pipeline.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card) (Focuses on architectural best practices and the most interesting for system design)

## Streaming pipelines architecture
[Build Modern Data Streaming Architectures on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)

  Very useful for real time analytics pipelines in general!

## Data Warehousing
[Datawarehousing on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-warehousing-on-aws/data-warehousing-on-aws.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card) (Redshift documentations gave me a lot more insights, may be becasue this paper is a bit old!)

[Database migration with Redshift as Target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/optimizing-dms-with-amazon-redshift/optimizing-dms-with-amazon-redshift.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)(Contains lots of insights for the database migration from on-prem to AWS!)


## Storage
[Storage Best Practices for Data and Analytics Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-data-lakes/building-data-lake-aws.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)

[Best Practices Design Patterns: Optimizing Amazon S3 Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/s3-optimizing-performance-best-practices/welcome.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)

These are the 2 best papers on S3 that I loved the most!

[Best practices for migration from RDBMS to DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/best-practices-for-migrating-from-rdbms-to-dynamodb/welcome.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)

  The only dynamoDB paper, I read going into exam!


## Containers
Not very useful for certification but lots of insights for containerizations in AWS and even in general! I have just skimmed through these papers.

[Containers on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/containers-on-aws/containers-on-aws.html)

[Running Containerized Microservices on AWS] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/running-containerized-microservices/welcome.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)


# How I read them
Definitely read the papers from the first 4 sections. ANd there are lots of references to other concepts that could give some deep understanding.

For example, while reading one of the papers, I encountered AWS Lake formation that I didn't know enough about! So, I made it a point to understand AWS lake formation well!

The best strategy is to read through the paper once, make notes of all extra concepts that you're not aware of. Later, read those non-aware concepts and read the whitepaper again (quickly this time) to connect the dots!
